# Capstone Project Proposal

## Tech Stack

The tech stack I will be using for my final project is:

### Front-End:
- **HTML & CSS** for structuring and styling the user interface.
- **Bootstrap** will be used to ensure a responsive design and faster UI development.
- **Google Analytics** will be integrated to track user behavior, analyze traffic, and improve the app based on user insights.

### Back-End:
- **Python with Flask** will handle the server-side logic and API development.
- **Bcrypt** will be implemented to securely hash user passwords.
- **PostgreSQL** will serve as the database, and **SQLAlchemy** will be used as the ORM for seamless interaction with the database.
- **WTForms** will be used for creating and validating forms efficiently.
- **Flask-Mail** will be used for sending emails (e.g., notifications or password resets).
- **Flask-Login** will handle user authentication and session management.

## Project Focus

I will create an **evenly focused full-stack application**, but the front-end will be crucial in capturing the userâ€™s attention. The user interface will be designed to look appealing and user-friendly, as the website will be deployed for real-world users.

---

## Application Type

The project will be a **dynamic website** designed to be fully responsive. It will be optimized for desktop, mobile, and other devices to ensure accessibility and usability across various platforms.

---

## Project Goal

The main goal of my project is to engage users with a visually appealing website that brings valuable information and encourages interaction. I want users to:
- Fill out a form.
- Request more information.
- Express interest in a quote.

Driving traffic to the website will also be a key goal in improving user engagement and visibility.

---

## User Demographics

The target demographic for my application consists of:
- **Homeowners** or **businesses**, specifically those interested in masonry work and home improvement services.

---

## Data Collection

The data I plan to collect includes:
- **Email**
- **Phone number**
- **Name**
- **Address**

I will use a form to collect this data, validate it, and then securely store it in the database. If I decide to implement user registration and login functionality, I will also collect and store user credentials.

---

## Summary

The project will focus on creating a full-stack dynamic website, engaging users, and collecting valuable data while ensuring a smooth user experience across devices. It will offer a combination of an appealing UI and efficient back-end functionality for managing user interactions, data, and requests.
