# Capstone Project One: Overview

## Step One: Initial Project Ideas

Choose up to 3 project ideas to propose to your mentor and the Springboard community.
Explore potential APIs that could be used in your project.

### Project Ideas:
1. **My friend's website for his home improvement business**
   - This website will serve as an online presence for a home improvement business, providing information on services, showcasing past projects, and allowing customers to reach out for quotes or inquiries.

### APIs:
- I plan to create my own API for this project, but I may consider using paid APIs if they make sense to integrate into the project (e.g., for location services, payment processing, etc.).

## Step Two: Project Proposal

### Project Description:
I want to build a **visually appealing website** that engages users and brings more visitors. The goal is to make the site **look professional** and be effective at **driving traffic**. The website will serve as both a marketing tool and an informational hub for users looking for home improvement services. It will focus on clear navigation, easy access to services, and compelling calls to action (e.g., request a quote, contact us).

## Step Three: Source Your Data

Once your mentor approves your proposal, determine the database design and which API youâ€™ll be using.

### Database Design:
- I will use **DrawSQL** to design the database schema.
- Some of the tables that might be included in the database:
    - **Users**: Stores user data (e.g., name, email, password).
    - **Services**: Stores details about the different services offered (e.g., masonry, powerwashing).
    - **Projects**: Stores information about completed or ongoing projects.
    - **Materials**: Tracks materials used in projects.
    - **Photos/Gallery**: Stores images for the gallery to showcase work.
    - **Invoices**: Tracks client invoices for services rendered.
    - **Reviews**: Stores customer reviews and ratings.
    - **Messages**: Stores messages sent from users (e.g., inquiries, requests).
